    ### GET /rules
    Returns a JSON array containing the server's rules:

    ...     "Wake up at 4 AM.",
    ...     "Take your medicine."

    Since some of the the rules require links, this view
    gives you the option to return rules in either Markdown
    or HTML format by specifying the `link_format` query parameter
    as either `md` or `html`. Specifying a different value than
    `md` or `html` will return 400.

        Build the markup for rendering the link.

        This will render `link` with `description` as its description in the given
        `target` language.

        Arguments:
            description (str):
                A textual description of the string. Represents the content
                between the `<a>` tags in HTML, or the content between the
                array brackets in Markdown.

            link (str):
                The resulting link that a user should be redirected to
                upon clicking the generated element.

            target (str):
                One of `{'md', 'html'}`, denoting the target format that the
                link should be rendered in.

        Returns:

                The link, rendered appropriately for the given `target` format
                using `description` as its textual description.
